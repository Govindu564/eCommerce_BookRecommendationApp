978068700282,0687002826,exclusion and embrace,"A Theological Exploration of Identity, Otherness, and Reconciliation",miroslav volf,religion,life at the end of the twentieth century presents us with a disturbing reality otherness the simple fact of being different in some way has come to be defined as in and of itself evil miroslav volf contends that if the healing word of the gospel is to be heard today christian theology must find ways of speaking that address the hatred of the other reaching back to the new testament metaphor of salvation as reconciliation volf proposes the idea of embrace as a theological response to the problem of exclusion increasingly we see that exclusion has become the primary sin skewing our perceptions of reality and causing us to react out of fear and anger to all those who are not within our evernarrowing circle in light of this christians must learn that salvation comes not only as we are reconciled to god and not only as we learn to live with one another but as we take the dangerous and costly step of opening ourselves to the other of enfolding him or her in the same embrace with which we have been enfolded by god is there any hope of embracing our enemies of opening the door to reconciliation miroslav volf a yale university theologian has won the 2002 louisville grawemeyer award in religion for his book exclusion  embrace a theological exploration of identity otherness and reconciliation abingdon 1996 volf argues that exclusion of people who are alien or different is among the most intractable problems in the world today he writes it may not be too much to claim that the future of our world will depend on how we deal with identity and difference the issue is urgent the ghettos and battlefields throughout the worldin the living rooms in inner cities or on the mountain rangestestify indisputably to its importance a croatian by birth volf takes as a starting point for his analysis the recent civil war and ethnic cleansing in the former yugoslavia but he readily finds other examples of cultural ethnic and racial conflict to illustrate his points and since september 11 one can scarcely help but plug the new world players into his incisive descriptions of the dynamics of interethnic and international strife exclusion happens volf argues wherever impenetrable barriers are set up that prevent a creative encounter with the other it is easy to assume that exclusion is the problem or practice of barbarians who live over there but volf persuades us that exclusion is all too often our practice here as well modern western societies including american society typically recite their histories as narratives of inclusion and volf celebrates the truth in these narratives but he points out that these narratives conveniently omit certain groups who disturb the integrity of their happy ending plots therefore such narratives of inclusion invite long and gruesome counternarratives of exclusionthe brutal histories of slavery and of the decimation of native american populations come readily to mind but more current examples could also be found most proposed solutions to the problem of exclusion have focused on social arrangementswhat kind of society ought we to create in order to accommodate individual or communal difference volf focuses rather on what kind of selves we need to be in order to live in harmony with others in addressing the topic volf stresses the social implications of divine selfgiving the christian scriptures attest that god does not abandon the godless to their evil but gives of godself to bring them into communion we are called to do likewisewhoever our enemies and whoever we may be the divine mandate to embrace as god has embraced is summarized in pauls injunction to the romans welcome one another therefore just as christ has welcomed you romans 157 susan r garrett coordinator of the religion award said that the grawemeyer selection committee praised volfs book on many counts these included its profound interpretation of certain pivotal passages of scripture and its brilliant engagement with contemporary theology philosophy critical theory and feminist theory volfs focus is not on social strategies or programs but rather on showing us new ways to understand ourselves and our relation to our enemies he helps us to imagine new possibilities for living against violence injustice and deception garrett added that although addressed primarily to christians volfs theological statement opens itself to religious pluralism by upholding the importance of different religious and cultural traditions for the formation of personal and group identity the call to embrace the other is never a call to remake the other into ones own image volfwho had just delivered a lecture on the topic of exclusion and embrace at a prayer breakfast for the united nations when the first hijacked plane hit the world trade centerwill present a lecture and receive his award in louisville during the first week of april 2002 the annual religion award which includes a cash prize of 200000 is given jointly by louisville presbyterian theological seminary and the
